# Grab WordPress RSS feed for offsite source

Hi! I'm a fun bit of code that allows you to call an offsite RSS feed to include in other projects.

I was originally intended for my creators newsletters to show his audience of new and fun projects he's working on.

While I work out of the box it's up to you to figure me out, including the html code I'm wrapped around as it may not be deal for you.

I require a 3rd party plugin to insert images into the RSS I call from to provide image support.
